Sorting is a common technique used in a variety of applications to organize data. There are 
multiple sorting algorithms that are available based on the use case. However, when dealing with very large data the sorting process can be very time-consuming when only a single thread of execution is allowed.

Multithreading of an application allows it to complete its tasks by splitting the work among various threads or parts of the process and executing them parallelly. Unlike processes, threads are lightweight and share resources like code, data, and open files. This report aims to compare if sorting algorithms can make use of multithreading to obtain better performance than traditional single-threaded versions of the same algorithm.
